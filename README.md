# Spotify-Prediction  <br />

# How can Spotify customers be predicted to save a song?  <br />

# Using Python, Pandas and Sklearn  <br />

Spotify is the world's most popular music streaming service.On that platform, most of us listen to music every day.However, at the time, the selection of music might be overwhelming.This project aims to predict whether a listener will save a song to their favorite playlist. <br />

The data came from Kaggle, where the Spotify API was used to scrape a listener playlist.In order to prepare the data and train and evaluate the model, we will use pre-processing methods like IQR, Zscore, and normalization.In order to solve this classification issue, we will then employ various statistical models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
